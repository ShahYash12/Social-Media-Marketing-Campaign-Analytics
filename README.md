**Marketing Analytics Project: Squatty Potty Case Study**

Overview
This project involves a marketing analytics analysis of the viral video campaign from Squatty Potty. The main objective was to assess the effectiveness of Squatty Potty’s campaign strategies, forecast future campaign outcomes, and identify potential areas for improvement based on historical data. This analysis provides insights into key marketing metrics, consumer response to advertising efforts, and recommendations for future campaigns.

Project Structure
The project includes the following main components:

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and preparation, handling any missing or inconsistent entries in the dataset to ensure accuracy in subsequent analysis.
Descriptive Analytics: An examination of historical data to summarize key marketing metrics, including views, conversion rates, customer demographics, and sales tied to the viral video campaign.
Forecasting: A 12-month forecast was generated to predict the performance of a new Squatty Potty viral video, which includes projected views, conversions, and expected revenue. Assumptions based on historical growth trends and industry insights were made to support the projections.
Customer Insights: Analysis of Facebook targeting data and demographic insights to assess Squatty Potty’s market coverage. Specific attention was given to identifying any underrepresented demographic segments that could be targeted in future campaigns.
Recommendations: Based on the findings, recommendations were provided for Squatty Potty's future promotional campaigns, including potential adjustments to pricing, targeting, and content strategies to enhance customer engagement and maximize conversions.
Key Findings
Campaign Effectiveness: The initial viral campaign led to a strong correlation between video views and sales. However, customer engagement tapered over time, indicating the need for periodic refreshing of ad content or new product-related media.
Forecast Projections: Based on historical data, the forecast for a follow-up viral video suggests potential for sustained revenue growth. However, maintaining viewer interest will be key, as view-based sales tend to diminish without content updates.
Customer Targeting: Analysis of Facebook targeting data reveals some under-targeted demographics, particularly older age groups and regions with lower ad saturation. Expanding targeting could help reach new customer segments and bolster long-term sales.
Methodology
Data Collection: Data was collected from Squatty Potty’s historical campaign metrics and demographic data from Facebook ads.
Analytical Approach: Time series analysis was used for forecasting, descriptive statistics to assess campaign metrics, and segmentation analysis to identify underrepresented target groups.
Tools Used:
Python for data processing and analytics
Excel for data exploration and verification
Visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to display insights from the analysis
Instructions to Run
Data Preparation: Place all data files in the data directory and ensure they are in the correct format.
Running Analysis: Run the main Python script squatty_potty_analysis.py to execute the full analysis pipeline, which will output descriptive statistics, forecasts, and recommendations.
Results and Visualization: The results will be saved in the output directory, with visualizations stored in output/visualizations.
Recommendations for Future Campaigns
Content Updates: Regularly refreshing viral content and experimenting with different video formats could help maintain viewer engagement.
Expanded Targeting: Consider expanding targeting to underrepresented groups, especially older age demographics and lower-saturation regions.
Pricing Strategy: Evaluate the price sensitivity of key demographics and consider price adjustments if customer acquisition rates show resilience to slight increases.
